# Development Roadmap

## Purpose

This document defines the implementation roadmap for Opportunity OS Version 1.0.

It specifies:

- development phases

- milestones

- dependencies

- deliverables

- acceptance criteria

The roadmap is optimized for iterative, AI-assisted software development.

# Roadmap Principles

Development follows these principles:

- architecture first

- vertical slices over horizontal layers

- working software at every milestone

- automated testing

- continuous integration

- documentation-driven development

Every completed phase should produce a deployable system.

# Phase Overview

Phase 0

Repository Foundation

↓

Phase 1

Data Acquisition Platform

↓

Phase 2

Intelligence Platform

↓

Phase 3

Application Platform

↓

Phase 4

MVP Release

↓

Phase 5

Post-MVP Expansion

Each phase builds upon the previous one without requiring architectural redesign.

# Phase 0 — Repository Foundation

## Goal

Create the engineering foundation.

Deliverables:

- repository structure

- CI pipeline

- coding standards

- shared libraries

- database migrations

- local development environment

- automated testing framework

Milestone:

Every engineer and AI coding agent can build and run the project locally.

## Completion Checklist

Phase 0 is complete when:

- repository structure matches the Engineering Kit

- package manager, Node, workspace, and TypeScript policies are enforced

- repository verification passes

- lint, build, and test commands pass

- Docker Compose configuration validates

- local PostgreSQL and Redis services are documented

- environment setup, production configuration expectations, and future validation contract are documented

- logging architecture and sensitive data policy are documented

- testing strategy is documented

- contribution, pull request, security, cross-reference, and document-numbering rules are documented

- no application code exists

- no business logic exists

- no APIs, connectors, AI workflows, or database schema implementation exists

## Phase 1 Readiness

Phase 1 may begin only after the Phase 0 completion checklist passes.

The first Phase 1 task must identify:

- owning package

- referenced Engineering Kit documents

- dependencies

- acceptance criteria

- required tests

- documentation updates

## Phase 1 Milestone 1 — Runtime Configuration And Validation

Goal:

Establish typed runtime configuration in `packages/config`.

Deliverables:

- environment schema validation

- typed configuration exports

- fail-fast configuration loading

- secret-safe validation errors

- package-level tests

- environment documentation consistency checks

Usage rule:

Future packages should consume configuration from `@opportunity-os/config`. They should not read `process.env` directly once they depend on this shared package.

Out of scope:

- apps

- APIs

- connectors

- AI workflows

- database behavior

- domain logic

- intelligence logic

- business processes

Next milestone dependency:

The next shared-infrastructure milestone must depend on `packages/config` for validated runtime values such as service name, environment, log level, exporter endpoint, service URLs, provider keys, and authentication settings.

Readiness gate:

- `packages/config` is implemented, tested, documented, and independently buildable through the workspace build

- all required and optional environment variables are validated and documented

- configuration errors are clear for local development and CI while remaining secret-safe

- `apps/` contains no application implementation

- no business logic, connectors, AI workflows, API routes, database implementation, or frontend implementation exists

- repository verification, lint, build, tests, and Docker Compose config pass

Handoff:

After this gate passes, the next shared-infrastructure milestone may consume `@opportunity-os/config` as the canonical source for runtime configuration.

## Phase 1 Milestone 2 — Shared Foundation

Goal:

Define and implement shared foundation packages without business behavior.

Packages:

- `packages/types`

- `packages/utils`

- `packages/errors`

- `packages/shared`

Ownership boundaries:

- `packages/types` owns generic shared TypeScript types only.

- `packages/utils` owns generic deterministic utilities only.

- `packages/errors` owns generic shared error contracts only.

- `packages/shared` owns shared infrastructure contracts and approved aggregation only.

Dependency direction:

- `packages/types` and `packages/utils` sit at the base.

- `packages/errors` may depend on `packages/types`.

- `packages/shared` may depend on `packages/config`, `packages/types`, `packages/errors`, and `packages/utils`.

Out of scope:

- business logic

- connectors

- APIs or API routes

- AI workflows

- database implementation

- frontend implementation

- app code

Implementation guardrail:

Phase 1 Milestone 2 must not introduce domain behavior, connector behavior, persistence behavior, application behavior, or user interface behavior.

Readiness gate:

- `packages/config`, `packages/types`, `packages/errors`, `packages/utils`, and `packages/shared` are implemented, tested, documented, and independently buildable

- repository verification enforces package boundaries and shared foundation dependency direction

- package-level tests run through the root workspace pipeline

- no business logic, connectors, APIs, AI workflows, database implementation, frontend implementation, or app code exists

- repository verification, lint, build, tests, and Docker Compose config pass

Next milestone dependency:

The next milestone must depend on the shared foundation packages for runtime configuration, generic type contracts, generic error contracts, deterministic utilities, logging contracts, request and correlation context contracts, and validation result contracts. Downstream implementation packages must not redefine these shared contracts locally.

# Phase 1 — Data Acquisition Platform

# Quality Gates

Every phase must satisfy:

## Architecture

- matches Architecture Specification

- respects platform boundaries

## Testing

- unit tests pass

- integration tests pass

- contract tests pass

## Documentation

- specifications updated

- API documentation generated

- migrations documented

## Observability

- logging enabled

- authentication enforced

- dependency scanning completed

# Definition of Done

A phase is complete only when:

- implementation is merged

- automated tests pass

- documentation is updated

- acceptance criteria are satisfied

- deployment pipeline succeeds

Partial implementation does not complete a phase.

# Success Criteria

Opportunity OS Version 1.0 is successful when:

- customer data is collected automatically

- customer problems are identified accurately

- Opportunities are generated with deterministic scores

- every recommendation is explainable

- the dashboard supports end-to-end exploration

- the platform is deployable and maintainable
